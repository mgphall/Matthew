PrimeTables

Im am pleased with my implemantation of Sieve of Eratosthenes and my modification so it counts the amount of primes found.
Im am happy with the ReturnTable method 
	
	
If i had more time i would improve the UX, Displaying the prime Table in a DataGrid proved to be very slow, so i would write my own custom control.
There is a property called  Estimate, this is passed into MakeSieve and creates a fixed size array, i would updated so it is altered depending on the about of primes required
